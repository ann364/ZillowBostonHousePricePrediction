# Boston House Price Prediction

[Boston Housing](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing/overview) is a Kaggle competition project.

The goal of this project is to evaluate house prices on training data and predict prices on testing data.
Eventually we want to see if there is relationship between predicted median value vs actual median value of houses.
We then want to retrieve median value of houses along with their house id.
